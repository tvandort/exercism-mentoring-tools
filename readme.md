# Exercism Mentoring Tools

Things I use to quickly run Exercism user submissions in a container.

Why?

I dunno, felt like learning how to do that.

Might be some benefit to running student submission code in a container, for instance it saves me from having to install multiple dotnet versions.

Build image:

`$ ./dotnet/build.sh`

source in bashrc or zshrc:

`$ ./dotnet/mentor.sh`

run:

`$ mentor-dotnet`
